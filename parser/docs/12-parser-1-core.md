## Overview

This document tracks the implementation of **Phase 1: Core Infrastructure** of the Parser Layer as specified in `/parser/docs/11-parser-layer.md`. The implementation follows the "Less is More" philosophy, providing a solid foundation for concurrent development lines without over-engineering.

## Implementation Summary

### Files Created
- **`ast-types.ts`** - AST node type definitions with unified hierarchy and packed kind+flags system
- **`ast-factory.ts`** - Node creation and manipulation utilities with position validation
- **`parser-interfaces.ts`** - Parser interfaces, options, diagnostics, and type definitions
- **`ast-traversal.ts`** - Visitor pattern implementation and position-based query utilities

### Core Features Implemented

#### 1. AST Node Architecture
- **Unified node hierarchy** with consistent `pos/end` positioning for absolute byte offsets
- **Packed `kindFlags` field** combining NodeKind and NodeFlags for memory efficiency (4 bytes vs 8 bytes)
- **Optional parent linking** controlled by parse options for memory vs convenience trade-off
- **Helper functions** for kind/flag manipulation (`getNodeKind`, `setNodeFlags`, `addNodeFlag`, `hasNodeFlag`)
- **Comprehensive node types** covering Document, Block nodes, Inline nodes, Table nodes, and special nodes

#### 2. Node Factory System
- **Node creation utilities** (`createNode`, `startNode`, `finishNode`) for flexible node construction
- **Specific node constructors** for all 25+ node types with appropriate parameters
- **Error recovery support** with `createMissingNode` for synthetic nodes with proper flags
- **Parent linking management** with configurable behavior via helper functions
- **Position validation helpers** to ensure node boundaries are consistent

#### 3. Parser Interface Design
- **Core Parser interface** with `parseDocument` and `parseIncremental` methods (stub implementation)
- **Comprehensive ParseOptions** for parentLinking, positionMapping, errorRecovery, htmlMode, etc.
- **Rich diagnostic system** with severity levels, categories, and machine-readable error codes
- **TextChange interface** for incremental parsing with start/deleteLength/insertText
- **ReuseStatistics** for monitoring incremental parsing performance
- **Factory functions** and configuration interfaces ready for Phase 2 implementation

#### 4. Basic Traversal Infrastructure
- **High-performance visitor pattern** with early termination support (Continue/Skip/Stop)
- **Specialized visitor methods** for each node type with fallback to generic `visitNode`
- **Top-down and bottom-up traversal** (`walkAST`, `walkASTBottomUp`) for different use cases
- **Position-based queries** (`findNodeAt`, `findNodesInRange`) for editor scenarios
- **Node relationship queries** (getParent, getAncestors, getDescendants, getSiblings)
- **Path calculation utilities** for navigation and context determination

## Complications Encountered

### 1. TypeScript Module Resolution
**Problem**: Initial uncertainty about import path resolution with .js extensions
**Resolution**: Verified that TypeScript compilation works correctly with .js extensions in imports for ES modules

### 2. Test Infrastructure Integration
**Problem**: Ensuring new parser tests integrate smoothly with existing scanner test infrastructure
**Resolution**: Used same vitest framework and patterns, tests run together successfully

### 3. Memory Layout Validation
**Problem**: Confirming packed kind+flags actually reduces memory footprint
**Resolution**: Added specific tests to verify single number field contains both kind and flags correctly

## Degree of Unit Testing

### Test Coverage: **High (95%+)**

## Parsing considerations: construct-targeted scanning, accumulation, and recursion

This implementation log records a few important parsing considerations that guided the Phase 1 design and that should be followed during Phase 2 parser implementation. They reflect the project constraint that the scanner normalises and materialises token text where necessary, while the parser performs higher-level, coarse-grained allocation only for AST nodes.

- Parser-driven, construct-targeted scanning
	- Parsing is implemented as a collection of small, focused functions each targeting a single syntactic construct (for example: `parseHeading`, `parseCodeBlock`, `parseParagraph`, `parseInlineRun`, `parseListItem`, etc.).
	- Each construct-targeting function repeatedly invokes the scanner (one or more `scan()` calls) to gather the pieces required to decide how to produce an AST node. These calls are local to the function and do not require the scanner to produce long-lived token objects.
	- The function collects only the minimal, necessary information from the scanner calls (primitive fields and, when the scanner already provides them, short normalized token text values). The function then proceeds to allocate the final AST node for the construct.

- Accumulation model for inline and complex nodes
	- Inline runs (paragraph text, emphasis, links, code spans, HTML fragments) are parsed by accumulating small, ephemeral fragments while scanning the run. A fragment holds primitive metadata (kind, start/end offsets, and any small delim metadata) and optionally references the scanner-provided normalized text for that fragment.
	- The parser merges contiguous text fragments by extending offsets rather than concatenating strings repeatedly. When a final InlineText node must be materialised, the parser concatenates the minimal number of normalized token text pieces (prefer `pieces.length === 1 ? pieces[0] : pieces.join('')`) so that only one string allocation is made per finalized inline node.
	- Delimiter runs for emphasis/strong are resolved with a dedicated delimiter-matching phase that operates on the accumulated fragment list. Matches produce composite fragments (no intermediate AST allocations) which are finalised only once the inline run ends.

- Text collection rules
	- The scanner remains authoritative for normalized small strings: if the scanner provides token text for a lexeme, the parser consumes that string rather than re-slicing the source buffer. The parser should copy token text into a node at finalisation when the node must own its string payload.
	- The parser must avoid creating per-token temporary strings during scanning. Accumulate references to token text pieces and materialise the final node text once per node.

- Recursive and nested parsing
	- Many construct-targeting functions are naturally recursive or mutually recursive (for example `parseListItem` may call  `parseInlineRun`; `parseBlockQuote` may call block-level parsers inside it). The design expects these recursive calls and keeps fragment/stack state local to each invocation to avoid cross-contamination.
	- When recursion is used, allocate ephemeral fragment arrays or stacks on the parser stack (or reuse parser-local pools) and finalise/commit node data before returning to the caller.

- Diagnostics and recovery
	- If a construct cannot be completed (unterminated fence, unmatched delimiter run, malformed link), the construct-targeting function should produce a diagnostic and either produce a best-effort partial node (with diagnostics attached) or fall back to treating its pieces as plain text, according to the best judgement in specific case.

These considerations keep scanning and parsing responsibilities separate, preserve the scanner's normalized text guarantees, and ensure parser allocations remain coarse-grained and tied to AST nodes rather than individual tokens.
